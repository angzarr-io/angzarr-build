//! End to end on angzarr-embedded and angzarr-router, at the family's pins:
//! the fixture apps under `tests/local` are workspaces of their own, each
//! generated from protos by its `build.rs` and built by cargo here.
//!
//! - `buyin-app`: the buy-in fixture's domain layer, adapters and
//!   `register()`, its components the scaffold with their bodies written,
//!   type-checked, then run: one command, a policy step each way, and a
//!   refusal answered by a policy.
//! - `kinds-app`: the kinds fixture (a typed refusal of each field kind, a
//!   command refusing several, several emits, a projector of two domains),
//!   built and run, a policy swapped for one written by hand.
//! - `blackjack-app`: the blackjack example's protos (the spec's): the
//!   generated layer and the scaffold of the day, `todo!()` bodies and all,
//!   type-checked. `bare-app` is the same for a domain with no events. Nothing
//!   of either is run, and the scaffold is written there by the test, not
//!   committed.
//!
//! They build the embedded runtime and its dependencies, fetched from the
//! network on a cold cache, so they are `#[ignore]`d from a plain `cargo
//! test` (and from the mutation runs, which would repeat them for every
//! mutant): `just test` runs them after the rest, `just test-slow` alone.
//! The three apps share one target directory.
